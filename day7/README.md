Task: Image transform

Task for examination:
- cdist implementation
- Compute vector mean and std (for large Ns), compare with CPU version.
- Implement sobel filter (and/or canny edge detection)
- Implement dilation and erosion filters
- Optimize one of OCV 1D/2D filters
- Matrix multiplication
- Image zoom (TODO: based on textures)
- DFT N = 32
